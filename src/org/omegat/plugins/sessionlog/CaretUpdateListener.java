/******************************************************************************
 SessionLog OmegaT plugin - Plugin for OmegaT (htpp://www.omegat.org) to track
                            the actions of a user during translation and storing
                            the log in an XML file.
                            This plugin keeps track of all the editions
                            performed by a user during the translation of a
                            project. The plugin works in a transparent way for
                            the user and all the information obtained is stored
                            in an XML file which can be created when the tool
                            is closed.
